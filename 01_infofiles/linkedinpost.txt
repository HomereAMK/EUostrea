The European native oyster, a keystone species, is often overlooked and under threat due to lack of awareness among the general public. But they are doing so much! on our plates, in our coastal marine area, for our future. Wild European native oyster populations are hard to find nowadays, they were everywhere centuries ago. Genetic info is needed to protect and restore this vital component of European marine ecosystems!


The European native oyster is a crucial species that often goes unnoticed and faces threats due to lack of awareness among the general public. Despite their importance in our diets, as well as in the coastal marine areas, and for our future, wild European native oyster populations are becoming increasingly scarce. But here's the thing, these oysters are in trouble. They're becoming as rare as a unicorn in the wild, and it's all because we're not paying enough attention to them. It is essential to gather genetic information to protect and restore this vital component of European marine ecosystems. By raising awareness about the importance of the European native oyster, we can ensure their conservation and safeguard our marine environments. Let us work together to promote their conservation and preserve the biodiversity of our coastal waters.
