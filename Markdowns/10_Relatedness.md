===========

>We first generated a file with allele frequencies (-doMaf 1) and a file with genotype likelihoods (-doGlf 3) for all samples (n=582) passing sample filtering and sites filtering criteria using ANGSD, with additional filtering of -hwe_pval 1e-6 -minmaf 0.05 -minMapQ 20 -minQ 20 -SNP_pval 1e-6. The frequency column from the allele frequency file was then extracted and used together with the genotype likelihood file by NgsRelate
